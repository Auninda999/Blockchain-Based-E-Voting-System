# Blockchain-Based-E-Voting-System

This is the simple blockchain based E-Voting system I implemented for the project/paper.
I used Ethereum Blockchain Platform, Solidity Programming Language, RemixIDE, Ganache and MetaMask crypto wallet. It is a very simple program,
after downloading the evoting.sol file just upload it in RemixIDE. After that compile the codes and test it.
